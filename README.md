# SQL Data Warehouse Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end modern data warehousing solution**, from raw data ingestion to business-ready analytics.

Designed as a **portfolio project**, it showcases **industry best practices** in:
- Data Engineering  
- SQL Development  
- Data Modeling  
- Analytics & Reporting

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

### 🔹 Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data **as-is** from source systems  
- Data ingested from **CSV files** into **SQL Server**
- No transformations applied

### 🔸 Silver Layer
- Data cleansing and standardization
- Data validation and normalization
- Prepares data for analytical consumption

### ⭐ Gold Layer
- Business-ready, curated datasets
- Modeled using a **Star Schema**
- Optimized for reporting and analytics
